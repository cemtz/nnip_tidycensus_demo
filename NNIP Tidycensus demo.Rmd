# Downloading Census Data using Tidycensus

You will need **Census API Key** to use tidycensus
You can get one here: <https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>


Resources used to put this demonstration together:

Analyzing US Census Data by Kyle Walker (Book):
<https://walker-data.com/census-r/index.html>

Basic usage of Tidycensus:
<https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html>

Working with Census microdata:
<https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/pums-data.html>

```{r}
#install.packages("tidycensus") ## To install package. Only has to be done once.

#Load Tidycensus library
library(tidycensus)
library(tidyverse) #another useful package for manipulating and reshaping data

## INSTALL KEY AND STORE IN R ENVIRONMENT
census_api_key("YOUR KEY GOES HERE", install = TRUE)
```

# Tidycensus has the following core functions
```{r}
get_decennial() # US Decennial Census API for 2000, 2010, 2020

get_acs()       # 1 (2005) & 5 (2005-2009) Year ACS

get_estimates() # Population Estimates by state, county, and MSA

get_pums()      # ACS Public Use Microdata Samples

get_flows()     # ACS Migration Flows
```

We'll focus on get_acs() and get_pums() for this demonstration.

# Pulling ACS data
```{r}
# SEARCH FOR VARIABLES

# detailed tables

View(var20)

# subject tables
